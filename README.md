# PSA-Squash-Tracker

An interactive R Shiny web application designed to explore historical and live squash rankings, player statistics, and tournament performance trends for the Professional Squash Association (PSA). Built and maintained by Lindsay Whipple as a continuation from my undergrad Senior Year Experience.

Overview

- View player profiles with headshots, countries, and current ranking trends

- Explore interactive ranking plots (weekly, monthly, yearly)

- Compare ranking changes over time with visual cues (arrows and colors)

- Search and filter historical rankings by date and gender

- Display player metadata including images and nationality flags
